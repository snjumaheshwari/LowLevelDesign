### Solid Principles


## Open-Closed Principle 
 
This Principle states that software entities should be open for extension, 
but closed for modification. 

When the requirement changes, you should be able to incorporate them by extending the existing classes but WITHOUT modifying them. 


Example - 

1. Notification Service
2. Coffee Machine
3. Board_Game
4. Pub Sub


Why we should not modify existing classes? 

a. Mistake-prone 
Not breaking existing functionality without working

b. Design become more readable, and maintainable.
