####  Logger System - [Complete]

* Logger follows chain of Responsibility design pattern. 
* Different handlers can handle request. 
* One handler if it can process the request, it will... else it will call its next handler through parent. 
* Advantage of having multiple handler is - every one can process request as they want and is seperated from the main logic.
